Peer review comment: 

Website is functional. After typing the pokimon name or pokidex number in the search bar, it displayed all abilities, moves, location, and evolutionary paths including the shiny option of the pokemon. I was also able to favorite the pokimon when clicking the favorite star and was also able to remove each pokimon from the favorites sidebar, however, I was unable to click on the pokimon in favorites for it to display. The random pokimon button is also functional with a random pokimon displaying. The website overall looks great! Good job!
